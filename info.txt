To implement the work we will use the following:
An Arduino UNO
A 16x2 I2C LCD
An HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor
A KINGSTATE KCG0603 buzzer
A Breadboard
Connection cables with male - female and male - male terminals

To implement the parking sensor system, we should think about how it works. The mode of operation was chosen to calculate the proximity distance through the ultrasonic sensor and adjust the sound reproduced by the buzzer according to the measured distance.
To complete the task, the appropriate program code should be developed and the Arduino uno properly connected to the display, sensor and buzzer.

It was chosen to multiply the measured distance by integers from one (1) to ten (10). This practice proved to be effective and we had the desired results. This happened because as we multiply the distance by a number, the final result grows and thus the delay command takes longer. So, as the distance decreases, so does the delay command. Depending on the distance, the repetition of the sound signal increases or decreases accordingly. According to the tests performed, it was found that we had satisfactory results by multiplying the measured distance by the number two (2).
Also, the most satisfactory sound performance from the buzzer was found to be with its setting values at two thousand (2000) Hz and seventy (70) msec.
